# Othello

## Board game + bot 

- What will the application do?  

The application will provide a computer version of the strategy board game *Othello*, also known as *Reversi*. 
The board consists of 8x8 squares, along with 64 pieces, each black on one side and white on the other. When a player places a piece, any opposing pieces between the piece that was just placed and another friendly piece (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) gets "flipped" and become friendly pieces. Game ends when a player has no moves left. Whoever has the most amount of friendly pieces on the board wins.

This application supports player vs player and player vs computer.

- Who will use it?

Anyone who's bored, or wish to practice Othello against a variable-difficulty robot.

- Why is this project of interest to you?

Board games are fun and interesting to program. Othello in particular, is neither too simply nor to complex to design. 
Also due to the fact that it's a strategy game that is not too complex, it should not be too hard to write an AI using a
tree search algorithm that can play the game proficiently.
